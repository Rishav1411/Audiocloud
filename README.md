# OnlySongs

Welcome to the OnlySongs repository! OnlySongs is a website designed to provide a platform for musicians and artists to share their artworks and engage with their audiences. This readme file will guide you through the project structure, technologies used, and how the recommendation algorithm works.

## Technologies Used

The OnlySongs website is built using the following technologies:

- **Firebase**: Firebase is a powerful and scalable platform that provides various services for building web and mobile applications. In this project, Firebase is utilized for authentication, database management, and hosting.

- **Flutter**: Flutter is an open-source UI framework developed by Google. It allows developers to create beautiful and responsive cross-platform applications. OnlySongs leverages Flutter for building the user interface of the website.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
OnlySongs/
├── lib/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── screens/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── main.dart
├── assets/
├── pubspec.yaml
├── firebase.json
└── README.md
```

- **lib/**: This directory contains the source code of the OnlySongs website.

  - **models/**: This directory holds the data models used in the application, such as User, Artwork, and Recommendation.

  - **screens/**: Here, you'll find the different screens of the website, including Home, Explore, Profile, and Authentication screens.

  - **services/**: This directory contains the Firebase service files responsible for handling authentication, database operations, and recommendation algorithm.

  - **utils/**: Utility files used throughout the project, such as constants, helper functions, and custom widgets.

  - **main.dart**: The entry point of the Flutter application, which sets up the initial screen and runs the app.

- **assets/**: This directory contains static assets, such as images and fonts, used in the OnlySongs website.

- **pubspec.yaml**: The configuration file for managing project dependencies and assets.

- **firebase.json**: Firebase hosting configuration file.

## Recommendation Algorithm

OnlySongs incorporates a recommendation algorithm that suggests music and artists for users to follow based on their preferences and usage patterns. Here's an overview of how the recommendation algorithm works:

1. User Preferences: The algorithm collects data on user preferences, such as the genres, artists, and songs they listen to, as well as their interaction patterns within the OnlySongs platform.

2. Data Analysis: The collected data is analyzed to identify patterns, correlations, and user preferences. This analysis includes factors such as frequency of listening, user ratings, and similar music/artists enjoyed by other users with similar preferences.

3. Similarity Matching: Based on the analysis, the algorithm identifies users with similar tastes and preferences to the current user. It calculates similarity scores between users using techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a hybrid approach.

4. Recommendation Generation: Using the similarity scores, the algorithm generates personalized recommendations for the current user. These recommendations may include new artists, trending songs, or upcoming events relevant to the user's interests.

5. User Feedback Loop: As the user interacts with the recommendations, the algorithm continues to gather feedback, including likes, follows, and user ratings. This feedback is then incorporated into the recommendation model, allowing it to continuously improve and provide more accurate suggestions over time.

Please note that the specifics of the recommendation algorithm may vary based on the implementation and additional techniques employed.
